# Full Stack Open (University of Helsinki)

During the Full Stack Open course, I have been immersed in a deep dive into modern web development, focusing on JavaScript-based web development and the construction of single-page applications with ReactJS. My skills have been sharpened by crafting REST APIs with Node.js and mastering other technologies such as Redux, MongoDB, GraphQL, and TypeScript.
