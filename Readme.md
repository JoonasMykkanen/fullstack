# Full Stack Open (University of Helsinki)

During the Full Stack Open course, I have been immersed in a deep dive into modern web development, focusing on JavaScript-based web development and the construction of single-page applications with ReactJS. My skills have been sharpened by crafting REST APIs with Node.js and mastering other technologies such as Redux, MongoDB, GraphQL, and TypeScript.

## Part 0: Building a Solid Foundation in Modern Web Development

I've begun by building a solid foundation in modern web development, learning how to support single-page applications with RESTful and GraphQL web services, all implemented with Node.js. I've also gained knowledge on TypeScript, React Native, and Continuous Integration, along with debugging applications, container technology, configuration, managing runtime environments, and databases.
