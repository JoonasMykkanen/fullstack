During the Full Stack Open course, I have been immersed in a deep dive into modern web development, focusing on JavaScript-based web development and the construction of single-page applications with ReactJS. My skills have been sharpened by crafting REST APIs with Node.js and mastering other technologies such as Redux, MongoDB, GraphQL, and TypeScript.

## Part 0: Building a Solid Foundation in Modern Web Development

I've begun by building a solid foundation in modern web development, learning how to support single-page applications with RESTful and GraphQL web services, all implemented with Node.js. I've also gained knowledge on TypeScript, React Native, and Continuous Integration, along with debugging applications, container technology, configuration, managing runtime environments, and databases.

## Part 1: Introduction to React and Essential JavaScript Features

My journey continued with an introduction to the React library, which is used for writing the code that runs in the browser. I've learned important features of JavaScript that are essential for understanding React.

## Part 2: Expanding React Skills: Rendering Data, Handling Forms, and Adding CSS Styles

Here, I expanded my React skills by learning to render data collections, handle user data submissions through HTML forms, fetch and handle data stored in a backend server, and add CSS styles to React applications.

## Part 3: Backend Focus: REST API Implementation and MongoDB Integration

In this part, I shifted focus towards the backend, implementing a simple REST API in Node.js with the Express library, and storing the application's data in a MongoDB database. By the end of this part, I had deployed my first application to the internet.

## Part 4: Backend Development Continued: Unit Testing and User Authentication

My backend work continued, with major themes including writing unit and integration tests for the backend, and implementing user authentication and authorization.

## Part 5: Frontend Testing and Token-Based Authentication

Returning to the frontend, I learned different testing methods for React code and implemented token-based authentication to enable user login for our application.

## Part 6: Managing State in Large React Applications with Redux and React Query

I learned about managing the state of large React applications using the Redux library, the React context, the useRedux hook, and the React Query library for server state management.

## Part 7: Exploring React Router, CSS Styling, Webpack, and Custom Hooks

This part allowed me to become familiar with React Router for dividing applications into different views based on URL, learn more ways to add CSS styles to React applications, understand how Webpack works, and learn how to define a custom hook.

## Part 8: Introduction to GraphQL for Browser-Server Communication

This part introduced me to GraphQL, Facebook's alternative to REST for communication between the browser and server.

## Part 9: Dive into TypeScript: Building End-to-End Features

Here, I dove into TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. I used the tools previously introduced to build end-to-end features in an existing ecosystem, learning to understand, develop, and configure projects using TypeScript.

## Part 10: Building Native Mobile Applications with React Native

This part helped me learn how to build native Android and iOS mobile applications with JavaScript and React, using the React Native framework. I developed an entire mobile application from scratch, learning to render native UI components with React Native, create beautiful user interfaces, communicate with a server, and test a React Native application.

## Part 11: Understanding Continuous Integration and Deployment with GitHub Actions

Here, I gained understanding of Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery systems, specifically how to use GitHub Actions for better product version management and safe deployment.

## Part 12: Containerization for Node.js and React Projects

I learned how to package code into containers for standard units of software, creating immutable execution environments for Node.js and React projects. I explored a completely new viewpoint for web development outside of the Node.js backend and React frontend, and experimented with many different and popular tools using containers.

## Part 13: Switching to Relational Databases: PostgreSQL and SQL Queries

In the final part of the course, I switched from MongoDB to relational databases and SQL query language, focusing specifically on PostgreSQL. I explored different NodeJS applications that use relational databases, addressing scalability issues and adopting some of the features of NoSQL databases.

Through this comprehensive journey, I have been equipped with a wide range of skills and knowledge that make me capable of tackling any full-stack web development project, from managing backend services to delivering high-quality frontend user experiences. I have also gained practical experience in deploying applications, integrating continuous delivery systems, and experimenting with a variety of tools and frameworks. The course has prepared me to adapt to changing technologies and to continue growing as a web developer.
